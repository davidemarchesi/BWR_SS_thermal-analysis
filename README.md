# BWRs Fuel Rod steady state thermal analysis

The aim of this repository is to contain both the numerical MATLAB code and the correspondent study developed by me during
the A.Y. 2022-2023 for the course of 'Multiphase systems and technologies' followed at Politecnico di Milano.

The works is completely described in the attached `.pdf` paper, and deals with the thermal analysis of a BWR's single fuel rod channel in steady state conditions.
